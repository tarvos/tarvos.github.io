Hello!  I’m an undergraduate at Stanford studying formal logic and the philosophy of mathematics, and a theatrical electrician and lighting designer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

If someone were to ask after my purpose in life, I’d probably say something about knowledge acquisition.  I cherish every phenomenological sense-datum I’ve been blessed with and every atomic proposition I might _a posteriori_ infer from it.  But between my memory and my solipsism I tend to forget about the vastness and richness of subjectivity, so I need my writing to remind me about my temporal bias.

This sounds pretentious, but ultimately my values come down to my delight in human experiences—both my own and others’—and I’d like to preserve as much information about them as possible.  This means that I’m a radical advocate of candour, [Open Source][1] for everything, and journals.

Because of that candour, I’m usually fairly permissive when my friends ask to read or write in my journals.  This has been somewhat challenging because I haven’t been staying in the same country for more than 3-6 months at a time, so I’ve finally obliged the tech bros who want me to digitize.

I hope to use this website to store some of the things I do, some of the things I think about, and some of the drama that I swear just spontaneously arises wherever I go.  It’s primarily for the people close to me, but if you can tolerate my handwriting, welcome\*!

\*and also please say hi.
